First sighted at 0705, observed for approximately 40 min.  Spent most of the time at base of big-leaf maple "sap wells"; fed actively but did not move around much.  First located by call, high-pitched keer spaced long minutes apart.  Seen well through scope at distance of 25 yards or so.  Full red cap and red throat boarded with black (no white).  A very striking bird looking quite pale by comparison to the much darker Red-Breasted Sapsucker.  Heavy white barring/ markings or spotting in back, wings and tail.  Primaries, secondaries, and tertials are heavily spotted with white - white tips to primaries.  White rump visible while perched.  Back very distinctive, barred w/ white the length of back with narrow stip of black down center; "absence of white lateral stripes, back heavily barred". White stripes in face above and below cheeks are bold.  Nape whitish, containing more dark flecking so that nape is somewhat darker than very clean facial stripes, but no red present and giving a dirty appearence.  Black "V" breast band below red throat, yellowish below, white into belly; flanks heavily barred gray and whitish, looks like pattern extends into belly, gary bars diffuse in connected v patterns.

He also entered checklists from the Lake Calumet area on seven dates in this period, beginning 17 Apr, plus a few abbreviated lists from scattered sites in the Chicago area.

[Milton Adair (20 Mar 1898 - 20 Dec 1986) kept hand-written notebooks spanning 27 Mar 1932 - 28 May 1976. His earliest notebooks focussed on botanical observations, primarily from the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore area, but over the years his focus shifted increasingly towards bird migration, particularly on spring migration in Jackson Park, Chicago, and environs. Most of Adair's checklists appear to include all through-migrants observed during migration, but few resident species. For the year 1950, Adair entered Jackson Park checklists on 91 dates in the first half of the year (spanning 3 Jan - 6 Jun), including a nearly unbroken string of checklists (60 out of 62 dates) from 19 Mar - 19 May. He also entered checklists from the Lake Calumet area on seven dates in this period, beginning 17 Apr, plus a few abbreviated lists from scattered sites in the Chicago area. In the second half of 1950, Adair recorded brief checklists (maximum 8 species) on 21 dates (including Jackson Park data on all but one date), 1 Oct - 26 Dec.

Adair's focus in his earliest notebooks was on the phenology of plants, primarily those of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore area, but during the course of the 1930's he became increasingly interested in the phenology of birds. The year 1939 marked a turning point in Adair's focus. This was the first year in which he regularly recorded data on bird migrants at Jackson Park, Chicago, including checklists on 36 dates (13 Mar-17 May) in the first half of the year and on 47 dates (20 Aug-28 Nov) in the second half of the year. Also in 1939, Adair paid increased attention to identifying birds of the Lake Michigan shoreline (including here some more difficult identiication groups such as shorebirds, gulls, and diving ducks). He also made day-trips (likely via commuter rail) to the Indiana Dunes, Wolf Lake, or the Orland Park/Palos area on 17 dates in spring and on 2 dates in fall of 1939. From late Dec 1939 through much of Jan 1940, Adair was in Florida (Lake Worth area, Palm Beach County). Data transcribed and uploaded to eBird in 2019 by Paul R. Clyne.

Notated this find as it was quite late migrant. Warm front came thru over 2 evenings prior, so yesterday felt like the first 'Spring' day, along with migration movement. This bird is probably waiting for winds to shift before taking off again.  I have already seen this species in yard last Fall.

His earliest notebooks focussed on botanical observations, primarily from the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore area, but over the years his focus shifted increasingly towards bird migration, particularly on spring migration in Jackson Park, Chicago, and environs. For the year 1941, Adair prepared checklists on 46 dates in the first half of the year, spanning 19 Mar - 22 May, and on 27 dates in the second half, spanning 9 Aug - 3 Dec; the autumn checklists are all brief (maximum 7 species). He entered data from Jackson Park on 40 dates in spring and on 27 dates in autumn, plus short checklists from South Shore (including Rainbow Beach) on 11 scattered dates. Checklists from outside the Jackson Park/South Shore area are limited to six dates, all in spring--twice from the Orland Park/Palos area and four times from the Indiana Dunes.

[Milton Adair (20 Mar 1898 - 20 Dec 1986) kept hand-written notebooks spanning 27 Mar 1932 - 28 May 1976. His earliest notebooks focussed on botanical observations, primarily from the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore area, but over the years his focus shifted increasingly towards bird migration, particularly on spring migration in Jackson Park, Chicago, and environs. Most of Adair's checklists appear to include all through-migrants observed during migration, but few resident species. For the year 1963, Adair's notebooks include data from 3 Mar to 29 May only, with records on 41 out of 84 dates in this period. These include one cursory checklist from Indiana Dunes State Park on 14 Apr, one incidental checklist from Hyde Park (arrival of Common Nighthawk on 16 May), but otherwise his 1963 checklists were confined to Jackson Park and Promontory Point (southern Burnham Park). Data transcribed and uploaded to eBird in 2018 by Paul R. Clyne. Additional transcriber's comments are enclosed in [square brackets].]
